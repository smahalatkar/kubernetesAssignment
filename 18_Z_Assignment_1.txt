Learning Objectives:-
Perform a rolling update of the container version
Roll back to the previous working state


Problem Statement:-
Your company's developers have just finished developing a new version of their candy-themed mobile game. 
They are ready to update the backend services that are running in your Kubernetes cluster. 
There is a deployment in the cluster managing the replicas for this application. 
The deployment is called candy-deployment. 
You have been asked to update the image for the container named candy-ws in this deployment template to a new version, linuxacademycontent/candy-service:3.

After you have updated the image using a rolling update, check on the status of the update to make sure it is working. 
If it is not working, perform a rollback to the previous state.
